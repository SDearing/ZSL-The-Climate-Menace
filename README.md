## Project Management Plan

### Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “GreenHouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.
### Cost
* £39 Unity licence
* Cost of our tutor getting mini-van licence so we can visit ZSL Whipsnade to present our app
* Around £500 per member for a desktop computer, keyboard and mouse to complete tasks
* £20 for any needed assets for our app to make it look more appealing to ZSL
### Scope
* This app is aimed towards students aged 12-16, this is because this is the age of the students that go to the sessions at ZSL to learn about climate change.
* We thought about adding a leaderboard to the end of the app to implement some competiveness between the students, however we felt like this was out of the scope as we feel we wouldn't have enough time to implement this and it may divert from the information we are trying to teach the students.
* We also decided the scope of the platform for the app will be web-based, this is because ZSL wants to put the app on their website 
### Time
We were given the first breif from ZSL on the 2nd of October and we have until the 7th of November where we will be presenting the final demo for our app.
### How we will Assure Quality
We will assure quality in our app, by first creating a detailed development plan in the form of a gantt chart, this is so we can assure that we know how much time we should be spending on each task, meaning that we manage our time effectively and allows us to be aware when we are falling behind.
Another way we will assure quality is by vigorously testing our app once we feel development has been completed. This will make sure we find and fix any errors or bugs within the app, to assure that it works properly when we present the app to ZSL.
### Communication
Our group will meet 3 times a week at the college, during these meetings we will discuss our progress on our tasks and what tasks we need to do for the upcoming week. While we are not at the college we will create a group on facebook for the purpose of discussing the project, we will use this group to ask for help on tasks. We will also create a google drive so that we can share the work we complete, this will allow us to use any work that is needed for other tasks and assure we are all working up to date.
### Risks
* Hardware Issues: During the development process some hardware of a computer that we are using may become faulty, this would massively delay development as the user of that computer would not be able to complete any of their tasks until that computer is fixed. This delay could prevent us from completing this project for the deadline. To reduce this risk we will make sure that we are using multiple computers with the required software to get our work done, i.e. one computer and one computer at home, so that if an issue happens with one system work can continue on the other. 
* Schedule Issues: Another risk is that we do not assign our time to do tasks correctly, this could be an issue because, for example, if we assign too little time for a task, we will obviously become behind schedule which could either lead to more time being wasted to correct the schedule, or we will have to skip tasks so we can keep to the schedule. None of these choices are ideal so it is ideal that our schedule is as realistic as possible. To assure we do not assign too little time for a task, we will make sure we give more than adequate time for each task, this makes sure that the tasks will be completed within the given timeframe and if completed with time to spare means that tasks can be worked on ahead of schedule.
* Personal Issues: During the development process a member/ members may be struck with illness or personal issues, this would result in them being unable to continue development until the issue was resolved, which could result in our app not being completed by the deadline set by the client. This risk will be reduced by making sure we have access to the work we are completing, this makes sure that if a member is disposed we can access their work and complete their tasks until they can work again. This may slow development time in the short-term but it assures that we can continue development in-spite of a member not being availible, instead of having to pause development until they can work again.
### Resources
* Microsoft Powerpoint: We will need this software when we present our concept pitch and our final design and demo to the client. This software will be helpful as it will be able to present our pitches for the app in a clear and structured manner.
* Unity: Unity will be the software we use to construct our app. Unity is a game engine that will help us in the contruction of menus and scenes in our app.
* Microsoft Excel: This software is used for creating spreadsheets. We will use excel to create gantt charts to plan out the amount of time we will spend on each aspect of the software development, so we can manage our time effectively.
* At least 5 Desktop computers: This is so we can have a computer for each member of our team, this means that we can all be developing our app at the same time, increasing the effeciency of our work.
* Internet Connection: This is so we can be connected up to the internet, this is so we can research solutions to possible problems that could occur during the development process. 
## Specification

### Concept

The aim is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change). 

### Story 

The story relates to the green house gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing proccess of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacutring proccess or segments of the green house gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the proccess once. Moreover once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which green house gases are emmitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### Setting

This game will be set in the present/modern day. 

### Application Structure 

The Menu will consist of four images, each representating a different area or enviroment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

<img src="BackgroundWithDividers.png" alt="GameMenu"
     title="GameMenu" />


Furthermore the graphic styles within the enviroments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production proccess of a product relevant to that enviroment. Moreover after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous draggable images, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 

After the green house gas chain has been compeleted and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released,with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.

Moreover once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### Players | Platform

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;

Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome

The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and  straightforward discussion  (as to what should be inputted).

### Genre 

	2D

	Educational

	Memory Game

### Intended Audience

The intended audience of the game is for casual or non-gamers of all genders spanning from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old.

### Sound Consideration

The game is not sound dependant since it was requested by the client(no sound or audio).

### Language 

The only language avaliable in the game will be english. 

## Game Mechanics | InGame Elements

### Camera 

The camera will be projected from a 2D front side angle of the menu, comics, pledges  and chain.

### General Movement

The users will be able to drop and drag certain objects across the screen (for the chain segment).
Whilst users will also be able to use the tap function (on the menu and comic slides to transition between scenes).

### Project Definition

Create an app for ZSL that teaches students how greenhouse gases are produced and how they affect certain habitats. Students will be required, at the end of the session, to create a pledge of how they can reduce their greenhouse footprint.
Project Specification

ZSL has given us the task of creating a web based application for children aged 11-16 which will be used in their climate change sessions. The purpose of the app is to teach students how greenhouse gases are produced and the effects they have of habitats and show them what they/society can do to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases. The app will need to include 4 habitats with their own greenhouse chain that will be displayed to the user: Artic (Plastic Bottles), British Wildlife(Beef), Ocean (Leaving electronics on standby/oil rigging), rainforest (Mobile phones). At the end of the app students will need to create ‘pledges’ of how they will reduce their greenhouse footprint.
### Tools and Techniques Needed for the Project
#### Tools
The following are tools needed to complete for this project:
* Microsoft Powerpoint: We will need this software when we present our concept pitch and our final design and demo to the client. This software will be helpful as it will be able to present our pitches for the app in a clear and structured manner.
* Unity: Unity will be the software we use to construct our app. Unity is a game engine that will help us in the contruction of menus and scenes in our app.
* Microsoft Excel: This software is used for creating spreadsheets. We will use excel to create gantt charts to plan out the amount of time we will spend on each aspect of the software development, so we can manage our time effectively.
#### Techniques
The following are techniques needed to complete this project:
* Interviews: During this development process we will interview our client, the first will be for the client to present their requirements for the app. During this interview, we will take extensive notes to ensure we remember and understand the requirements of the clients. The other interview will be when we present the final version of the app.
* Presentations: It is vital that we have good presentation skills, this is so we can keep the clients attention during the presentations and to make sure our ideas for the app are presented in a clear and interesting manner.
* Prototyping: While developing our app, we will first create a version of the app which will only fufil some of the requirements of the user, creating the first prototype. We will then develop upon the prototype to add more features to the app creating a new prototype, we will then iterate this process and until the app is fully developed.
### Schedule

-Monday 2nd-Sunday 8th: Create Idea for project

-Monday 9th- Sunday 15th: Create Pitch for project 

-Tuesday 17th October: First Review

-Monday 16th- Sunday 29th: Develop demo for app and design product design document

-Monday 30th October: Second Review

-Tuesday 7th November: Final Presentation

### Time Management Plan
To make sure that we manage time effectively and keep to the deadlines given above in the schedule, we will need to make sure we use effective time management skills. A time management skill we will use is by setting goals/milestones, we will do this because it will help us track our progress as if we hit a milestone within the time we set to complete it we will know that we are working at the right pace. Another time management skill we will use is splitting the workload between each team member, this is so that multiple tasks are being worked on at once, increasing the efficiency of our group as we will be able to complete more tasks than if we worked on each task together.
### Gantt Chart for Development

### Critical Reasoning Before Development
The first thing we needed to think about was where we would host our app as where we would host it would affect the way we implement our code, we originally thought we could make a downloadable app but as the clients wanted the app on an ipad and the apple store requires a payment to host a developed app, we decided to make the app web-based. A benefit of using a 
### Monday 2nd- 8th
We first started with a 1 hour sprint to put our ideas together, we began brainstorming ideas of what the main gameplay of the game would be. We decided to go with an item finding game where the user would have to find certain items in environments, which would give the user information based on each item (how greenhouse gases are created by the item etc.). We also decided on a main menu where the user would be able to decide which environment they would be using (this would depend on the environment table they are at in the ZSL session). We then spent the rest of the week fine tuning this idea and creating concepts of how the app interface would look. In our second sprint on the 5th we then decided on the aesthetic of the app, we decided upon using a comic book style as we felt that would be appealing for the children using the app.

This week’s sprints first started with our group meeting and discussing what we had achieved before the first week, Luke Shead had created the pitch presentation, Joe and Matthew had created some storyboards of how the app would function, Luke Bruni had created some concept art of the main menu and the artic habitat background and Sam had started the backlog of the previous sprints we had completed. Once we had confirmed that the tasks from last week were complete, we then assigned each other tasks that we needed to complete within a 45 minute timeframe (See in table sprint 1). This sprint was focused on our pitch and adding details to certain parts of our pitch, for example we needed to add more details to our storyboard to include the part where the students would give their pledges. Once we had completed the tasks we took an hour break then moved onto our second sprint. This sprint was more focused on how we would manage our project (see in table sprint 2); a way we are doing this is by creating user stories, so we have clear simple tasks that we can complete in our sprints.
### Tuesday 17th: First Review
On this date we visited ZSL Whipsnade to present our concept idea to 2 representatives of ZSL. We presented our idea for the app through a powerpoint presentation (Find in the repository in the file ZSL-climate-change-concept-pitch.pptx). We also used verbal communication to present to our clients about our ideas for the app, we made sure we spoke clearly and slowly so that our points could be fully understood. We also used non verbal communication such as hand gestures to emphasise our points and to keep the client engaged during the presentation so that they can fully understand what our idea is. In the presentation we first showed our aims for the app which were to make students more aware of the issues of climate change, to show them the effects of greenhouse gases, what the main causes of greenhouse gases are and what the students can do to reduce their greenhouse footprint. We also showed our design concept for the main menu for the app which was met with positive feedback. After our presentation we were then given feedback, we found that we had not fully met the clients aims as they wanted us to focus less on the game aspect of the app and instead implement a chain making mechanic that allows the user to create a greenhouse chain.
## Critical Reasoning after First Review
After obtaining feedback from the ZSL Clients, we realised that we needed to make changes to our app as it did not meet all the client's requirements, which was to focus less on creating a game for the app and to focus on allowing the user to create a green house gas chain, these changes are needed because we have to meet the requirements of the client. To make these changes we are going to remove the item finder mechanic from our app and instead replace it with a section that will show the user all the parts of a chain and will ask then ask the user to create the chain.
